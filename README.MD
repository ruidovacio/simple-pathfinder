### How to use

This project uses the gem colorize, if you don't have it installed you can use
`bundle install to fetch the necessary dependencies.

And then you can just do `ruby run.rb` on your terminal to use the program, which will solve the maze.

### Editing paths

The file *grid.txt* allows you to create your custom maze. 
The only requirement is that all the traversable space has to be enclosed by asterisks (*), which represent walls. You can then use whitespace to expand the interiors.
FInally, use 3 and 4 to respectively set the starting and finishing points.
